# Noxy the Dragon

## Species
Dragon, western, winged, feral/quadrupedal


## Gender
Cisgender male


## Pronouns
He/him/his, they/their/theirs


## Morphology
Feral/quadrupedal

### Body
Lithe, toned, general structure somewhere between a big cat and a horse. Size of a very large horse, maybe slightly larger.

### Wings
* Typical western quadrupedal wings
* Membrane is the same color as the body

### Forepaws
Three toes with dewclaws. Toes can function as fingers, dewclaws as thumbs.

### Hindpaws
Three toes, no dewclaw. Digitigrade. Details below:

#### Toes
* Symmetrical, all the same size and shape
* Middle toe extends out past the inner and outer toes by about half the length of a toe-tip, with the ground-contacting part of the foot (the middle metatarsal bone) also extending out the same length
* Medium-length. Not quite as long as an eagle's toe but longer than a wolf's toe
* Wider at tip of toe than the rest of the toe
* Joints between the sole and the tip of the toe are relatively straight and smooth, little to no "roundness" in those joints
* Tip of toe is round, almost spheroid (except with some flatness where it contacts the ground) and wider than the rest of the toe 

#### Claws
* Similar shape to the biggest talon on an eagle toe
* Slightly wider as it emerges from the toe as compared to an eagle toe
* Emerges from the top-front of the toe, not the front of the toe (also much like an eagle talon)

#### Sole
* No pads
* Two large round contact surfaces with a slight indentation between them. All symmetrical.
* Where the sole meets the ankle, the form is like the letter 'W' - the ground-contacting parts of the sole on the inside and outside go further back than the middle. (for example, look at the bottom rendering [here](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/24825327/) (not this character, just a relevant image))

### Genitalia

#### Penis
One of two penises, either canine-style or equine-style. Never both.
* Typical knotted canine penis, allowing for some artistic creativity for some dragon-like features. Dark grey/black color, glowing bright blue stripe along the bottom.
**OR**
* Typical flared equine penis, allowing for some artistic creativity for some dragon-like features. Dark grey/black color, glowing bright blue stripe along the bottom.

#### Other
* Dark grey/black scrotum
* Typical anus


## Coloration/texture
Overall color is dark grey/black. Texture is smooth, like a thick leathery skin. Bright green, glowing stripes.

### Stripes
All stripes are bright green and glowing. Slightly curved, slightly tapering at the ends. Details:

#### Head
* 3 stripes on top of muzzle
* One large mask-like stripe covering both eyes and both eyebrows

#### Body
* Stripes along the top of the back and top of the tail
* Stripes along the fronts of the fore and hind legs, and the leading-edge ("arm") of the wings

### Paws
The undersides of the paws (fore and hind) are the same bright glowing green as the stripes. This covers the bottoms of the toes and the soles.

### Eyes
Blue, glowing. Same blue as on the underside of the penis.


## Visual references
None of the notes here are meant to be negative towards the artists that did the work. These art pieces just predate this character's design decisions, so I'm calling out the differences to avoid confusion where the description and the art differ.

  * These are more or less perfect. The toes could be slightly longer, but apart from that these are ideal.

  * Great overall reference except for genitalia and hindpaws (defer to the 3d model and the above description)
* [Pinup by Ovens](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/14532738/) (NSFW)
  * Note: The toes in this are slightly longer than I would prefer, and the middle joint bulges out a little too much. Also, the penis is outdated (not canine or equine)
