## Morphology
Feral/quadrupedal

### Wings
* Typical western quadrupedal wings
* Membrane is the same color as the body

### Forepaws
Three toes with dewclaws. Toes can function as fingers, dewclaws as thumbs.

### Hindpaws
Three toes, no dewclaw. Digitigrade. Details below:

#### Toes
* Symmetrical, all the same size and shape
* Middle toe extends out past the inner and outer toes by about half the length of a toe-tip, with the ground-contacting part of the foot (the middle metatarsal bone) also extending out the same length
* Medium-length. Not quite as long as an eagle's toe but longer than a wolf's toe
* Wider at tip of toe than the rest of the toe
* Tip of toe is round, almost spheroid (except with some flatness where it contacts the ground) and wider than the rest of the toe 

#### Claws
* Similar shape to the biggest talon on an eagle toe
* Slightly wider as it emerges from the toe as compared to an eagle toe
* Emerges from the top-front of the toe, not the front of the toe (also much like an eagle talon)

#### Sole
* No pads
* Two large round contact surfaces with a slight indentation between them. All symmetrical.
* Where the sole meets the ankle, the form is like the letter 'W' - the ground-contacting parts of the sole on the inside and outside go further back than the middle. (for example, look at the bottom rendering [here](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/24825327/))

### Genitalia

**OR**
